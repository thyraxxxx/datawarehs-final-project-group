# DataWare Final Project – Bicycle Theft Analysis

## Group Members
- Thyra Barnes – Data & EDA Lead  
- Stella Kwate – Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering Lead  
- Shawna Halladeen – Modeling & Evaluation Lead  
- Deksan Said & Naheed Imani – Deployment & API Lead  

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Toronto bicycle theft data from 2014-2019 and builds a predictive model to estimate the probability that a stolen bike will be recovered.  
The final solution includes:
- Data exploration and visualization  
- Feature engineering and model building  
- Model evaluation   
- A Flask API that serves the trained model for predictions
